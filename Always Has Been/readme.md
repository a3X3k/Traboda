- From the hint given in the question, **Look up in the BLUE sky ! It's a bird, it's a PLANE or wait .. It's both ? But how ?** we can understand that the image has to be analysed in different planes.
- Using **Stegsolve** we can analyze images in different planes by taking off bits of the image.

## Installation

```
$ wget http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar -O stegsolve.jar
$ chmod +x stegsolve.jar
$ mkdir bin
$ mv stegsolve.jar bin/
```

## Usage

- Stegsolve can be invoked by placing the image in the /bin folder and running stegsolve.

```
$ java -jar stegsolve.jar
```
